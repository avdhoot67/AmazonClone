## Description
<p>This is a clone of Amazon's main web page, built solely with HTML and CSS. The project focuses on replicating the layout and design, without any functionality like shopping cart or user login.</p>
<hr>

## Features
<ul>
  <li><strong>Responsive Navbar:</strong> A functional navigation bar using flexbox, including the Amazon logo, address section, search bar, language options, sign-in, orders, and cart.
    <ul>
      <li>Added a dropdown in the search bar and language options.</li>
      <li>Implemented a datalist to suggest items based on input.</li>
      <li>Hover effects enhance user interaction on border elements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Animated Background:</strong> The main background image transitions between two images using <code>@keyframes</code> CSS animation for a smooth fade-in/out effect, when hovered over it.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Product Shop Section:</strong> A grid layout for displaying product boxes using flexbox, allowing products to wrap on smaller screens.
    <ul>
      <li>Hover effects on each product box change the border color for better interactivity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Hover and Transition Effects:</strong> Various elements like product boxes and buttons have hover effects, looks cool but sometimes annoying.
    <ul>
      <li>For example, the "blueborder" class applies a smooth transition effect when hovered over.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>

## Future Enhancements
<ul>
  <li>Plan to use JavaScript to add interactivity (I've just started learning JS, which is why haven't used in project yet).</li>
  <li>Implement media queries to make the website fully responsive.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

## Credit
<p>This project was inspired by the Apna College tutorial. While the tutorial helped guide the initial structure, approximately 70-80% of the project was completed through my own efforts, with applying new concepts and customizations.</p>
