This is my first Git repository containing Replica of Amazonâ€™s web page with only HTML and CSS. 
Author - Avdhoot Shinde

Description:
This is a clone of Amazon's main web page built using only HTML and CSS. The project focuses on replicating the layout and design without any functionality like shopping cart or user login.

Features:
1.Responsive Navbar:
A functional navigation bar using flexbox, including the Amazon logo, address section, search bar, language options, sign-in, orders, and cart.
Ive added drop down in the search bar,language options and used a datalist which suggests the some items based on input.Hover effects are applied on border elements to enhance user interaction.

2.The main background image transitions between two images using @keyframes CSS animation for a fade-in/out effect.

3.Product Shop Section:
A grid layout for displaying product boxes in the shop section, using flexbox and allowing products to wrap on smaller screens.
Custom hover effects on each product box, changing border color on hover for interactivity.

4.Hover and Transition Effects:
Various elements like product boxes and buttons have hover effects, adding interactivity and improving the user experience. For example, the "blueborder" class applies a smooth transition effect on hover.

Future Enhancements : Can Use javascript to add of interactivity to website(just started learining js thats why ive not used it) and also can make use of media queries
to make website resposive.

Credit : This project was inspired by the Apna College tutorial. While the tutorial helped guide the initial structure, approx 70-80% of the project was completed through my own efforts, expanding on the concepts and adding my own customizations.
